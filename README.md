# Rural Mindscape

The "Rural Mindscape" project aims to develop a web application
that provides mental health support and counseling services specifically designed
for rural youth. The web app will serve as a platform where rural youth can
connect with qualified psychiatrists, access mental health resources, and receive
personalized guidance and treatment for their mental health concerns.
